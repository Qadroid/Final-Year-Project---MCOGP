# MCOGP - Modular Container Orchestration GUI Platform

## Information about this repository
This repository contains (for now) a mix of the code used for backend of a main host used for orchestration of child clusters, the code for the backend and frontend of customer-facing and self-hosted implementation of the platform, and the code used for orchestration of containers and nodes.

The 3 main aspects for now are:
- The SaaS type host
    - An implementation of the orchestration platform used to manage clusters per user.
    - Interfaces with the backend
- The main backend for each cluster
    - Each user would have at least on of these control nodes on their system used to manage their containers and nodes.
    - API based management
- GUI Frontend
    - Used to interface with the backend or the SaaS host.
